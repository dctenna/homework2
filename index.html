        Those who have visited <b>Krakow</b> at least once know that time slows down there, life begins after sunset, and discussions about art may be held until dawn. It is hardly surprising that one of the most magical cities of Poland has been favoured
        by writers – it was the place of residence of Polish Nobel Prize winners: Czesław Miłosz (awarded in 1980) and Wisława Szymborska (awarded in 1996), as well as world-renowned writers Stanisław Lem and Sławomir Mrożek. Today, one of the most popular
        inhabitants of the city is poet Adam Zagajewski.
